As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 1.18.2 or higher.

Changes:
* Set default part offset render distance to 16
  This resolves performance issues due to too high render distances.
  Existing worlds will have to manually change their configs for this change to apply (partOffsetRenderDistance).
  Closes #1261
