As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 1.1.1 or higher.

Changes:
* Reduce number of chunk-refreshing sendUpdate calls, CyclopsMC/CyclopsCore#40
* Only send mechanical machine tile data to clients when gui is open
  This significantly reduces lag when machines
  are actively working in the background.
  Closes #630
